        <h2>How to play:</h2>
        <h3>In this game, players on each team will attempt to guess the celebrity their team member has on their card. There will be three rounds. In the first round, the acting team member can say anything but the celebrity's name. In round 2, they can only say three words, and in round 3, they can only act. </h3>
        <h3> Each actor has a minute to make their team gues as many celebrities as possible. Each celebrity guessed is a point for their team. When the minute is up, a player from the next team has a chance to act for a minute...and so on until the cards for that round are used up.</h3>
        <h2>Good luck!</h2>
